Abstract: More women are running for political office than ever before. A growing body of literature has considered how media coverage may differ significantly between men and women candidates. Despite this, few have examined the direct effects of gendered coverage on the perceptions of candidates. This paper examines how voters respond to political statements that weaponize feminine stereotypes against women. I draw on three survey experiments conducted on large samples of the American public to illustrate the effects of weaponized stereotypes. This paper makes three key contributions to the literature. An initial experiment reiterates the conventional wisdom that feminine stereotypes harm perceptions of women candidates. Second, I show how feminine stereotypes disproportionately harm women of color. Finally, I demonstrate how in-party attachment mitigates the negative effects of this news coverage. This paper supports existing research on gender stereotyping but critically introduces two scope conditions that mitigate their effects.
